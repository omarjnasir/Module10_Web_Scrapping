# Module10_Web_Scrapping
Module 10-Web Scrapping

In this module, the planet MARS is being explored. Explored in the sense that its images are being scrapped from the available web sites. There are some sites , which are friendly and others not-so-friendly. In this exercise, we are scrapping only friendly sites and obtaining all four hemisphere images. In the first deliverable python notebook was used (.ipynb) and in the second and third deliverables the .py files were used. The script was used in conjunction with a modified html file. 

Non-Relational Data Base Mongo was used which was more appropriate for the task.
